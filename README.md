# BHARAT INTRNSHIP ( DATA SCIENCE PROJECT)
# Project Overview
# Objective
The project aims to build a spam classifier for SMS (Short Message Service) messages. The goal is to create a model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham).

# Project Components
The project is likely organized into several key components:

* Data Collection:
  
   Gathering a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the spam classifier.

* Data Preprocessing:
  
   Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. This involves tasks such as removing irrelevant characters, handling missing data, and converting text data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  
  Understanding the characteristics of the dataset through statistical analysis and visualizations. This step helps in uncovering patterns and gaining insights into the distribution of spam and ham messages.

* Text Vectorization:
  
  Converting text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models. This often involves techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.

* Model Development:
  
  Building a machine learning model, likely using a classification algorithm such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, or a deep learning approach like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers.

* Model Evaluation:
  
   Assessing the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

* Model Deployment (Optional):
  
   If applicable, deploying the trained model for real-world use, allowing it to classify SMS messages in real-time.

* Documentation:
  Creating comprehensive documentation that explains the project's purpose, methodology, and the usage of the spam classifier. This documentation is crucial for anyone who wants to understand, reproduce, or build upon the work.
